            <h2>üèôÔ∏è Course Project: City Design in Accordance With UN Sustainability Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Problem Definition:</strong> Design a sustainable city of approximately 1500 sq. km, aligned with sustainability goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Findings From White Paper:</strong> The white paper titled "Streets ‚Äì The Living and Life" by Prakash Hegde and Aryan H S focuses on using course projects to bridge theoretical concepts with real-world applications, specifically in the field of algorithms.</li>
                <li>The document explores the diversity of street life across cities, focusing on cultural, social, and artistic aspects, with a detailed study of Mumbai‚Äôs streets in December 2022. It examines the unique dynamics of the city, including challenges like overcrowding and affordability. Indian train travel is highlighted, showcasing a 16-hour journey with cost-saving strategies. Mumbai‚Äôs local train system is praised for its efficiency, with frequent services on three major lines (Western, Central, and Harbour) and affordable fares (‚Çπ15-25 for 60 km), effectively managing the city's dense population and traffic compared to Bangalore.

<li>The paper also speaks about Matheran, a car-free hill station that offers a peaceful view with fresh air and peaceful architecture. People come there and travel by walking or on horseback. The accommodation here is a bit expensive but it is available at affordable prices. It is a model for an eco-friendly, pollution-free city.</li>

<li>Mumbai‚Äôs extremes are highlighted, from upscale Bandra to Dharavi, the world's largest slum. Areas like Andheri host students, while Bandra houses celebrities, reflecting the city‚Äôs diverse demographics. Overcrowded transit hubs like Dadar and the growth of slums underline urban planning challenges. Mumbai‚Äôs street life showcases a mix of culture, development, and socio-economic disparities, making it a microcosm of India's urban dynamics.</li>

                    <td><li>Problem Statement: Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 focuses on making cities and human settlements safe, effective, and sustainable. 
                        This Business case Study focuses on the Utilization of Natural Resources that aligns with SDG 11. Natural resources such as solar, wind, water, and waste are often underutilized, while pollution, energy shortages, and inefficient waste management grow more and more. 
                        We are here to decode, How can urban areas use these resources more efficiently to create safe, healthy and sustainable cities?</li>

<li>Solutions: In Prakashavan- We have Major and Minor Industrial Areas, Metro, Railway, Highrise Apartments, Luxury Centers and much more. A city that utilises it Natural Resources sustains and thrives much more better with Mother Earth.</li>

<li>1)Solar Energy
By equipping rooftops, public infrastructure, and urban spaces with solar panels, this city can generate clean energy while reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
Example for this is, Our Lovely Bangalore, India, implemented a solar incentive program, encouraging residential solar installations and saving 150 MW of electricity annually (Source: Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, India).</li>

<li>2)Wind Energy
Urban areas can utilize small-scale wind turbines or hybrid solar-wind systems to meet localized energy demands.
Example for this is, London‚Äôs Olympic Park integrates wind turbines into its sustainability plan, supplying renewable energy to public infrastructure (Source: UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy).</li>

<li>3)Water Management
Cities can implement rainwater harvesting, recycle greywater, and utilize small-scale hydropower systems to manage water resources efficiently.
Example for this is, Singapore‚Äôs innovative new water program recycles treated wastewater into potable water, meeting 40% of the nation‚Äôs water demand (Source: Singapore‚Äôs Public Utilities Board).</li>

<li>4)Waste-to-Resource
Organic waste can be converted into biogas or compost, while non-organic waste is recycled or used for energy generation.
One of the best example is, Sweden transforms over 99% of its household waste into energy and other usable forms, drastically reducing its reliance on landfills (Source: Swedish Waste Management Association).</li>

<li>Data and Analytics</li>
                        
<li>1)Solar Energy
-Contribution of solar power to total energy consumption.
-California generated 32% of its electricity from solar energy in 2022, reducing CO‚ÇÇ emissions by 28 million metric tons annually (Source: California Energy Commission).</li>
                        
<li>2)Wind Energy
-Percentage of energy supplied by wind power.
-Denmark relies on wind energy for 50% of its electricity, reducing its carbon footprint significantly (Source: Danish Energy Agency).</li>

<li>3)Water Management
-Volume of water saved through recycling and harvesting.
-Australia's urban water-sensitive programs save 50 billion liters of water annually (Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics).</li>

<li>4)Waste-to-Resource
-Proportion of waste recycled or converted into energy.
-South Korea recycles 95% of its food waste, producing bioenergy and organic fertilizer (Source: Korea Environment Institute).</li>
    
<li>What can we learn and Implement this in our city Prakasavan.</li>
<li>1)Launching a Solar Roof Initiative with low-interest loans for solar panel installation.
Equip public buildings (schools, hospitals) with solar panels.
Create solar-powered streetlights to save energy</li>

<li>2)Identifying windy locations like hills or open areas for small wind turbine installation.
Combine solar and wind systems for uninterrupted energy.</li>

<li>3)Rainwater harvesting systems for new constructions.
Setting up greywater recycling plants to treat household and industrial wastewater for reuse.
Small reservoirs or retention ponds in urban planning to store and reuse rainwater.</li>

<li>4)Seegregaton with different bins for organic and inorganic waste.
Building a biogas plant to convert organic waste into fuel.</li>

                        <li>5)This can be done through Educational Events across the City, Gamifying, Giving Task with Rewards, Partnering with local business,etc. This creates a strong community which helps the city to foster and grow.</li>
                        <li>Benefits of Resource Utilization for SDG 11:
-Reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
-Enhances urban growth against climate change.
-Creates economic opportunities through green jobs</li>

<li>1. Problem Statement
Prakashavan's Context:
Prakashavan is a growing municipality with 5 lakhs as the population and ‚Çπ5 lakhs as the yearly average household income. Serious housing affordability issues have engulfed the city:</li>

<li>Growing Population at 15 percent in the last ten years has surpassed the growth in its housing supply.
Median Rent of over ‚Çπ20,000 a month(source;Hindustan times), the cost accounting for nearly an entire third of the earned incomes.
Rise of Informal Settlements: 12% of the population lives in substandard housing.(source;prakashavan statistics)
Gentrification: The rise of high-income groups has led to rising property prices, displacing low-income families.(source;wikipedia)</li>

<li>Real world examples(source;deccan herald)
Vienna, Austria: Faced housing shortages and rising rents during rapid urbanization in the mid-20th century.
Bhopal, India: Experienced housing deficits due to urban migration and unplanned growth.
Cape Town, South Africa: Struggled with informal settlements and a growing population post-apartheid.</li>


<li>2. Solution: Prakashavan's Housing Initiative
Inspired by successful models from cities like Vienna, Bhopal, and Cape Town, Prakashavan brought in the strategy:</li>

<li>a. Affordable Housing Policies:
Implementation of rent control policies to keep annual rent increases up to 5% (CONTROLS INFLATION TOO)
Legislations that would require developers to provide 30% of new units under affordable housing.</li>
                        
<li>b. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs):
Partner with private builders to build 10,000 subsidized units within five years.
Developers get tax benefits and instant clearances for affordable projects.(bhopal)</li>
                        
<li>c. Urban renewal projects:
Transformation of wasted government land into affordable dwellings.
Resettlement of families from slums with organized mixed-use communities</li>

<li>d. Benefit for the citizen
Benefits to first-time homemakers with incomes less than ‚Çπ3 lakhs 
Introduction of housing loans at less interest rates for middleclass families.
presently Karnataka government under ASHRAYA scheme is giving 1.5 lakh to 2.5 lakh per house to BPL holder but the government can do more to help financially.</li>
                        
<li>e. Innovative Housing Designs:
Low-cost modular housing in the inspiration of prefab systems of Singapore, construction costs reduced by 20-30%
Green and energy-efficient buildings to cut down utility costs(in order to aid sustainability).</li>
                        
<li>3. Data and Analysis
Pre-Implementation</li>

<li>Housing deficit: ~20,000 units.
Average monthly rent: ‚Çπ22,000 (~44% of average income).
Informal settlement population: ~60,000 people.
After 5 Years of Initiatives: 
12,000 affordable units constructed, thus reducing housing deficit by 60%
Informal settlement population decreased 30% because of the relocation projects
Rents in affordable units are ‚Çπ15,000; so, middle-class families could afford to live.
Rent without intervention: ‚Çπ30,000/month (~60% of household income).
ide taken from;(SOURCE: QUORA)
Vienna's Public Housing: The stable rents made it housing affordable for middle-class people.
Bhopal's Smart City Initiative: Comparable redevelopment programs have enhanced the lives of informal settlers.
Cape Town's Integration Model: Reduced social inequality by integrating income groups in housing projects.</li>

<li>4. Conclusion</li>

<li>Inclusive Planning: Involvement of communities decreased resistance to relocation.
Affordability: Rent caps ensured long-term housing affordability.
Economic Boost: Increased disposable income led to a 15% increase in local spending.(calculated using ExpenseCount.com).</li>
                        
<li>Challenges:
Funding Shortfalls: Initial state government funding was inadequate.
Land Acquisition: Legal disputes made redevelopment projects to be implemented late.
Hesitation from Developers: The fear of losses due to profit hindered the private sector involvement.</li>

                    <td><li>PROBLEM STATEMENT:

1. High Pollution: Cities emit significant amounts of air and noise pollutants from automobiles, factories, and energy consumption, which pollutes the environment and endangers human health.
2. Overuse of Resources: Cities consume too much water, energy, and land resources, which causes damage to nature and leads to shortages.
3. Traffic and Congestion: Cities cause heavy traffic, which leads to pollution, waste of time, and dirty air, all of which negatively affect the health of people and the environment.
4. Waste Problems: Cities generate so much waste that most cities don't have a proper recycling or disposal system, resulting in overflowing garbage and pollution.
5. Loss of Nature: The growth of cities takes away the parks, forests, and other green areas of the nature. This will reduce the wildlife and the environment gets hotter.
6. Water Issues: Cities also pollute the water bodies through wastes from the industries and the households, and utilize excess water causing shortages and bad quality.
7. Ineffective Buildings: Most buildings in the cities waste energy since they are not constructed to be effective in energy use, increasing pollution and harming the environment.
8. Vulnerability to Climate Change: Cities may not always be prepared for climate change, such as a heatwave or flood that can damage infrastructure and cause harm to residents.</li>

                        <li>2)Time Efficiency refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run relative to the size of the input, Space Efficiency refers to the amount of memory or storage required by an algorithm to run because, in many situations, memory is a limited resource, especially when dealing with large datasets or constrained environments. An algorithm that uses less space is generally more efficient, as it consumes fewer resources and can handle larger inputs.It's crucial because, in real-world applications, the speed of execution can determine the feasibility of a solution, especially with large inputs or when many operations need to be performed in a short time.</li>
