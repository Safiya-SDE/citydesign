            <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Course Introduction</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design Analysis and Algorithms:</strong> The course involves designing efficient solutions, keeping time and space complexity in mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms currently studying:</strong>In this course, I have studied a wide range of fundamental and advanced topics in computer science and data structures, including time complexity, space complexity, recursion, heaps, backtracking, hashing, skip lists, tries, red-black trees, AVL trees, binary trees, and binary search trees. Additionally, I have explored advanced tree structures like Fenwick trees and various types of sorting algorithms. The course also covered graph algorithms such as Kruskal's, Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall, Warshall's, Prim's, and Bellman-Ford algorithms. Lastly, I delved into string-matching algorithms, including Rabin-Karp, Boyer-Moore, and Knuth-Morris-Pratt, providing a comprehensive understanding of these essential computational techniques.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Math Foundations, Tracing, Hashing</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>DFS, BFS</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Trees, Graph</strong>
                    <li>Trees are the most common structure to represent hierarchies as they allow placement of data in a parent-child relationship. Different varieties of trees have their unique set of operations and properties which make them suitable for different scenarios. Below is an outline of how and why these structures cater and optimize the challenges:</li> 

<li>1. General Tree: 
   - It allows storing data in hierarchy but without having a rigid structure
   - Suitable for more complex hierarchies such as organizational charts, file systems and so on
   - Does not enhance capabilities for some operations such as search or balance</li>

<li>2. Binary Search Tree (BST):
   - The left node is a child of the parent that is lesser than the parent, and the right node it greater than the parent.
   - Useful for systems where the datawords are volatile and require a lot of search, insertions and deletions.
   - However, they can become lopsided which can reduce their efficiency in the worst instances potentially to O(n).</li>

<li>3. AVL Tree:
   - It is a specific type of binary search tree where the height of the left and right sub trees cannot differ by more than 1.
   - A search, insert, and delete operations in an AVL tree would roughly have a time complexity of O(log n).
   - Especially useful in situations where constant speed of searching for data is necessary for example a database.</li>

<li>4. 2-3 Trees:
   - It is a multi way search tree where a node can have either 1 or 2 keys but remains self balancing.
   - 2-3 trees are low height trees thus allowing O(log n) runtime for any kind of operation.</li>
                    
<li><strong>Algorithms:</strong></li>
<li>Kruskal's Algorithm:Greedy approach which chooses the smallest edges in non-decreasing order, so no cycles are formed.
Best for sparse graphs (few edges).</li>
                        
<li>Prim's Algorithm:
Greedy approach that grows the spanning tree by choosing the smallest edge connecting a vertex in the tree to one not in the tree.
Best for dense graphs (many edges).</li>
                        
<li>Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Greedy approach that computes the shortest path from a source to all other nodes.
Works best for graphs with non-negative weights.</li>
                        
<li>Bellman-Ford Algorithm:
Iterative approach that computes shortest paths, even with negative edge weights.
The value really comes when detecting negative weight cycles.</li>
                        
<li></li>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:
DP solution to find shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.
Effective when dealing with small to medium-sized dense graphs.</li>
                </ul>

1. Problem Statement
Prakashavan's Context:
Prakashavan is a growing municipality with 5 lakhs as the population and ‚Çπ5 lakhs as the yearly average household income. Serious housing affordability issues have engulfed the city:

Growing Population at 15 percent in the last ten years has surpassed the growth in its housing supply.
Median Rent of over ‚Çπ20,000 a month(source;Hindustan times), the cost accounting for nearly an entire third of the earned incomes.
Rise of Informal Settlements: 12% of the population lives in substandard housing.(source;prakashavan statistics)
Gentrification: The rise of high-income groups has led to rising property prices, displacing low-income families.(source;wikipedia)

real world examples(source;deccan herald)
Vienna, Austria: Faced housing shortages and rising rents during rapid urbanization in the mid-20th century.
Bhopal, India: Experienced housing deficits due to urban migration and unplanned growth.
Cape Town, South Africa: Struggled with informal settlements and a growing population post-apartheid.



2. Solution: Prakashavan's Housing Initiative
Inspired by successful models from cities like Vienna, Bhopal, and Cape Town, Prakashavan brought in the strategy:

a. Affordable Housing Policies:
Implementation of rent control policies to keep annual rent increases up to 5% (CONTROLS INFLATION TOO)
Legislations that would require developers to provide 30% of new units under affordable housing.
                        
b. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs):
Partner with private builders to build 10,000 subsidized units within five years.
Developers get tax benefits and instant clearances for affordable projects.(bhopal)
                        
c. Urban renewal projects:
Transformation of wasted government land into affordable dwellings.
Resettlement of families from slums with organized mixed-use communities

d. Benefit for the citizen
Benefits to first-time homemakers with incomes less than ‚Çπ3 lakhs 
Introduction of housing loans at less interest rates for middleclass families.
presently Karnataka government under ASHRAYA scheme is giving 1.5 lakh to 2.5 lakh per house to BPL holder but the government can do more to help financially.
                        
e. Innovative Housing Designs:
Low-cost modular housing in the inspiration of prefab systems of Singapore, construction costs reduced by 20-30%
Green and energy-efficient buildings to cut down utility costs(in order to aid sustainability).
                        
3. Data and Analysis
Pre-Implementation

Housing deficit: ~20,000 units.
Average monthly rent: ‚Çπ22,000 (~44% of average income).
Informal settlement population: ~60,000 people.
After 5 Years of Initiatives: 
12,000 affordable units constructed, thus reducing housing deficit by 60%
Informal settlement population decreased 30% because of the relocation projects
Rents in affordable units are ‚Çπ15,000; so, middle-class families could afford to live.
Rent without intervention: ‚Çπ30,000/month (~60% of household income).
ide taken from;(SOURCE: QUORA)
Vienna's Public Housing: The stable rents made it housing affordable for middle-class people.
Bhopal's Smart City Initiative: Comparable redevelopment programs have enhanced the lives of informal settlers.

Cape Town's Integration Model: Reduced social inequality by integrating income groups in housing projects.

4. Conclusion

Inclusive Planning: Involvement of communities decreased resistance to relocation.
Affordability: Rent caps ensured long-term housing affordability.
Economic Boost: Increased disposable income led to a 15% increase in local spending.(calculated using ExpenseCount.com)
Challenges:
Funding Shortfalls: Initial state government funding was inadequate.
Land Acquisition: Legal disputes made redevelopment projects to be implemented late.
Hesitation from Developers: The fear of losses due to profit hindered the private sector involvement.
