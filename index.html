            <h2>üèôÔ∏è Course Project: City Design in Accordance With UN Sustainability Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Problem Definition:</strong> Design a sustainable city of approximately 1500 sq. km, aligned with sustainability goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Findings From White Paper:</strong> The white paper titled "Streets ‚Äì The Living and Life" by Prakash Hegde and Aryan H S focuses on using course projects to bridge theoretical concepts with real-world applications, specifically in the field of algorithms.</li>
                <li>The document explores the diversity of street life across cities, focusing on cultural, social, and artistic aspects, with a detailed study of Mumbai‚Äôs streets in December 2022. It examines the unique dynamics of the city, including challenges like overcrowding and affordability. Indian train travel is highlighted, showcasing a 16-hour journey with cost-saving strategies. Mumbai‚Äôs local train system is praised for its efficiency, with frequent services on three major lines (Western, Central, and Harbour) and affordable fares (‚Çπ15-25 for 60 km), effectively managing the city's dense population and traffic compared to Bangalore.

<li>The paper also speaks about Matheran, a car-free hill station that offers a peaceful view with fresh air and peaceful architecture. People come there and travel by walking or on horseback. The accommodation here is a bit expensive but it is available at affordable prices. It is a model for an eco-friendly, pollution-free city.</li>

<li>Mumbai‚Äôs extremes are highlighted, from upscale Bandra to Dharavi, the world's largest slum. Areas like Andheri host students, while Bandra houses celebrities, reflecting the city‚Äôs diverse demographics. Overcrowded transit hubs like Dadar and the growth of slums underline urban planning challenges. Mumbai‚Äôs street life showcases a mix of culture, development, and socio-economic disparities, making it a microcosm of India's urban dynamics.</li>

    <h1>Affordable Housing in Prakashavan</h1>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Prakashavan is a growing municipality with 5 lakhs as the population and ‚Çπ5 lakhs as the yearly average household income. Serious housing affordability issues have engulfed the city:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Growing Population at 15 percent in the last ten years has surpassed the growth in its housing supply.</li>
        <li>Median Rent of over ‚Çπ20,000 a month (source: Hindustan Times), the cost accounting for nearly an entire third of the earned incomes.</li>
        <li>Rise of Informal Settlements: 12% of the population lives in substandard housing. (source: Prakashavan Statistics)</li>
        <li>Gentrification: The rise of high-income groups has led to rising property prices, displacing low-income families. (source: Wikipedia)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-world Examples:</strong> Vienna, Austria faced housing shortages and rising rents during rapid urbanization in the mid-20th century. Bhopal, India experienced housing deficits due to urban migration and unplanned growth. Cape Town, South Africa struggled with informal settlements and a growing population post-apartheid (source: Deccan Herald).</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Inspired by successful models from cities like Vienna, Bhopal, and Cape Town, Prakashavan brought in the following strategies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Affordable Housing Policies:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementation of rent control policies to keep annual rent increases up to 5% (controls inflation too).</li>
                <li>Legislations requiring developers to provide 30% of new units under affordable housing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs):</strong> Partner with private builders to build 10,000 subsidized units within five years. Developers get tax benefits and instant clearances for affordable projects (example: Bhopal).</li>
        <li><strong>Urban Renewal Projects:</strong> Transform wasted government land into affordable dwellings. Resettle families from slums into organized mixed-use communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Benefits for Citizens:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>Benefits to first-time homemakers with incomes less than ‚Çπ3 lakhs.</li>
                <li>Introduction of housing loans at lower interest rates for middle-class families.</li>
                <li>Under the Karnataka government‚Äôs ASHRAYA scheme, providing ‚Çπ1.5 lakh to ‚Çπ2.5 lakh per house to BPL holders.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Innovative Housing Designs:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Low-cost modular housing inspired by prefab systems of Singapore, reducing construction costs by 20-30%.</li>
                <li>Green and energy-efficient buildings to cut down utility costs, aiding sustainability.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data and Analysis</h2>
    <h3>Pre-Implementation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Housing deficit: ~20,000 units.</li>
        <li>Average monthly rent: ‚Çπ22,000 (~44% of average income).</li>
        <li>Informal settlement population: ~60,000 people.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>After 5 Years of Initiatives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12,000 affordable units constructed, reducing the housing deficit by 60%.</li>
        <li>Informal settlement population decreased by 30% due to relocation projects.</li>
        <li>Rents in affordable units reduced to ‚Çπ15,000, making housing affordable for middle-class families.</li><li>Rent without intervention projected to be ‚Çπ30,000/month (~60% of household income).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Ideas Inspired By:</strong> Vienna‚Äôs public housing, Bhopal‚Äôs smart city initiative, and Cape Town‚Äôs integration model reduced social inequality and enhanced housing accessibility.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inclusive Planning:</strong> Community involvement decreased resistance to relocation.</li>
        <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Rent caps ensured long-term housing affordability.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Boost:</strong> Increased disposable income led to a 15% increase in local spending (calculated using ExpenseCount.com).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Funding Shortfalls:</strong> Initial state government funding was inadequate.</li>
        <li><strong>Land Acquisition:</strong> Legal disputes delayed redevelopment projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Hesitation from Developers:</strong> Private sector involvement was hindered by fears of profit loss.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="container">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High Pollution:</strong> Cities emit significant amounts of air and noise pollutants from automobiles, factories, and energy consumption, which pollutes the environment and endangers human health.</li>
        <li><strong>Overuse of Resources:</strong> Cities consume too much water, energy, and land resources, which causes damage to nature and leads to shortages.</li>
        <li><strong>Traffic and Congestion:</strong> Cities cause heavy traffic, which leads to pollution, waste of time, and dirty air, all of which negatively affect the health of people and the environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Waste Problems:</strong> Cities generate so much waste that most cities don't have a proper recycling or disposal system, resulting in overflowing garbage and pollution.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of Nature:</strong> The growth of cities takes away the parks, forests, and other green areas of the nature. This will reduce the wildlife and the environment gets hotter.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Issues:</strong> Cities also pollute the water bodies through wastes from the industries and the households, and utilize excess water causing shortages and bad quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Ineffective Buildings:</strong> Most buildings in the cities waste energy since they are not constructed to be effective in energy use, increasing pollution and harming the environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Vulnerability to Climate Change:</strong> Cities may not always be prepared for climate change, such as a heatwave or flood that can damage infrastructure and cause harm to residents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High Pollution:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Encourage people to use buses, trains, bicycles, and electric cars instead of traditional vehicles to reduce pollution.</li>
                <li>Add more parks and trees to clean the air and make the environment better.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Overuse of Resources:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Conserve Water: Install low-flow faucets and encourage people to collect rainwater.</li>
                <li>Conserve Energy: Fit energy-saving bulbs and install solar panels to reduce energy wastage.</li>

    <h1>Environmental Impacts in Urban Areas</h1>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>There are several reasons why negative environmental impacts have been realized in urban areas, including limited public spaces, lack of sustainable transportation, air and noise pollution, traffic congestion, flooding caused by improper drainage systems, and climate change. All these factors make urbanization worsen the conditions by overpopulation and decrease in quality life.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <h3>Limited Public Spaces:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop more accessible and affordable open spaces that can be used by the public, such as parks and gardens.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sustainable Transportation:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Expand public transport systems like buses, metros, and cycling lanes.</li>
        <li>Promote walking and reduce the use of personal vehicles by promoting electric vehicles (EVs).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Air and Noise Pollution:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shift to electric vehicles to reduce emissions.</li>
        <li>Reduce industrial and vehicular noise pollution by enforcing strict regulations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Traffic Management:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Promote public transport over private cars.</li>
        <li>Designate areas for walking and cycling to enhance urban mobility.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Flooding Issues:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement proper drainage systems to manage rainwater effectively.</li>
        <li>Maintain green spaces to absorb rainwater and prevent urban flooding.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Climate Change:</h3> 
     <ul>
        <li>Use sustainable urban planning that has low carbon footprints.</li>
        <li>Make crowded places car-free to reduce emissions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Government Initiatives:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Set up budgeting for building infrastructure supporting public transport and non-motorized mobility.</li>
        <li>Start campaigns that make people change their behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data and Analytics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Air Pollution Statistics:</strong> 52% of small particle pollution comes from vehicular emissions; if these were changed to EVs, then it would reduce by 15%.</li>
        <li><strong>Traffic Data:</strong> Only 8% of people in India own cars, and yet traffic congestion is rampant because of inadequate public transport and infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Flood Insight:</strong> Poor drainage system and too much concrete areas lead to urban flooding in India during heavy rains.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson Learnt</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reducing environmental degradation requires sustainable urban planning.</li>
        <li>Public participation and behavior changes are necessary for the success of green initiatives.</li>
        <li>Strategic interventions by the government can help transition to cities that are sustainable.</li>
        <li>Data-driven insights reveal where there is a scope to improve and work on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Targeted solutions like expansions in public spaces, infrastructures, and transport in green can reduce the urban footprints to a remarkable level. It requires efforts from all parties: government and business along with the masses.</p>

                        <li>2)Time Efficiency refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run relative to the size of the input, Space Efficiency refers to the amount of memory or storage required by an algorithm to run because, in many situations, memory is a limited resource, especially when dealing with large datasets or constrained environments. An algorithm that uses less space is generally more efficient, as it consumes fewer resources and can handle larger inputs.It's crucial because, in real-world applications, the speed of execution can determine the feasibility of a solution, especially with large inputs or when many operations need to be performed in a short time.</li>
